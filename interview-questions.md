# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
  Functions are reusable pieces of code. Can have lots of different code inside such as arguments. They are like a giant umbrella of information. You can name each function. 

  Researched answer:
  Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. It is excevited when "something" invokes it. It always returns an output, can be used many times, and should be as generic as possible.


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
  The difference is that .map() looks at each element in an array while .filter() has a true/false code that your array has to go through.

  .map() is an array method, returns to us a completely new array.

  .filter() is also an array method, like map, but it has a built in if/else statement so it looks for true/false values. It returns back what we "filtered" through it. 

  Researched answer:

  The .map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. It calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. It does not execute without values. 

  The .filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function). Also does not execute without values.


3. What is the difference between map/filter and a for loop?

  Your answer:
  A for loop iterates from a defined start and end point with a defined number of times. Map/filter only go through the array once.


  Researched answer:



4. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
  console.log is used for developers, we shouldn't count on it when defining a function. It's helpful when testing out a piece of code. A return would live inside a function and can be used in reference inside the function.

  Researched answer:
  console.log prints out information to the console. returns a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made. 


5. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:
  Parameters. They are used in a function as placeholders for information.

  Researched answer:
  The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value. The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.


6. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Pair programming allows for partners to share and equally participate when coding. They take turns being the driver, where a partner is working on the live code. The driver then pushes the code up for the other partner to have access to it. It is about working together on a single project.

  Researched answer:
  Pairing involves having 2 programmers working at a single workstation. One programmer "drive" aka operates the keyboard while the other "navigates", watches, learns, asks, talks and makes suggestions. In theory, the driver focuses on the code at hand and the navigator focuses on a level of abstraction thats higher. 


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I loved learning about higher order functions! They make life easier ^_^ It's cool to know that there are certain built-in methods that already do most of the leg work. I also really enjoyed the team building excercises. It was fun to see everyone laugh and be silly.
